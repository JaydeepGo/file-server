#File server
This is a normal File Server demo and add a local jupyter-notebook hosted over local network.

This Project is used to represent basic functionality of file server and provide a platform to code anywhere-anytime
I use PHP for login process and a python script for file download-upload.

## Usage
1. Change database login in `connect.php` file.
2. Change path of `python-script` file in `fileserver.sh` file.
3. Create database using `cc.sql` file.
